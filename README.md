# This script is used to generate Dungeons and Dragons dices rolls.
# Dices are described as 'ndx', with n the number of dices to roll, d the d letter and x the number of faces a dice has.
# For exemple, '2d8' stands for 2 dices of 8 faces.
# Direct acces from a command line is supported : typing 'python dices.py 2d8' will work.
# It is possible to run the program in interactive mode with the 'interact' parameter. In this mode, the program will generate dice roll as soon as a code is entered, so typing directly '2d8' will perform the dice roll. It will also run in loop, meaning that you can enter another code directly afer a roll performs. Typing 'exit' will likely kill the program.
